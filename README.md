# Minesweeper-JS

This is a Minesweeper game built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.   

The board is visualised using HTML and CSS. I have attempted to make it visually similar to Google's Minesweeper game.  I have used jQuery to handle events and make changes to the HTML elements. Usual Minesweeper rules are followed.  

There are three levels: Easy, Medium, Hard. Click the reset button to reset the game.    
Left click → Open a cell  
Right click → Mark/unmark a cell as a mine  
No. of remaining mines is displayed at top left in red. You win when you have succesfully clicked all the cells that are not mines.
